              The puzzler VR app is a great introduction for those with no VR
              experience. This is a project that focuses on how to design VR
              environments by building it as pleasant and understandable as
              possible. The game, it’s challenging but not difficult, that makes
              it fun and increases the curiosity of the user to discover more of
              VR. This is very similar to “Simon Game” in which the objects
              randomly light up in a certain order and the player has to click
              following that order. The project took me more time than expected,
              but this helped me find ways to do it more efficient, like
              building half of the dungeon with torches and lights and then
              create a copy of it, rotate it and stick them together. Created a
              new empty game object to later increase or decrease the whole
              building after the user tests.
            </p>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
              The Puzzler is designed in a simple and neat way that makes it
              great to introduce VR to those that have never experience it, easy
              movement, clickable buttons and background sound that merges into
              the environment. Tha game is very straightforward, players
              understand what has to be done once the game starts.

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
                Statement of Purpose: The Puzzler is a simple and easy to use mobile
                VR app that engages new VR users to solve a puzzle similar to the
                Simon game in a challenging and fun way.

            <h3>Persona</h3>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>
                My user for this project is my husband. The user can help the designer
                understand what can be improved in the VR app. Such as the feeling, if
                there is any motion sickness, sizes. Updating every time there is a
                change can be tedious but it definitely saves time and you can finish
                your project with more confidence.

              <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>
                  In my sketches I tried to draw what I wanted in my VR app, having
                  something on paper helped with how I wanted to start building.

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <h4>User test 1</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>
                For my first user test, I asked a user with very little VR experience
                the questions below to help judge if the scale of the building and
                objects in the scene felt appropriate.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Q: How big do you feel?</li>
                <li>A: Feel like this dungeon is either too small or I’m too big</li>
                <li>Q: What is the mood of the place you are in?</li>
                <li>
                    A: Feels mysterious, someplace I would not dare myself to go in if
                    it were real life
                </li>
                <li>Q: How comfortable is it to see the things around you?</li>
                <li>
                    A: I can see everything but feels really small, I feel like I'm in a
                    can of sardines.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
                I had to increase the size of the building so it did not feel like the
                user will hit their head entering the dungeon.
            </p>
            
            <h4>User Test 2</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>
                My second test was done after adding 2 billboard signs to start and
                restart the game and background sound
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Q: What do you see in this scene?</li>
                <li>
                    A: A billboard that has a welcome message and a start button. And a
                    castle building behind it.
                </li>
                <li>Q: How does the size of the billboard feel like?</li>
                <li>A: Feels right, looks like an “open curtain” kinda thing.</li>
                <li>Q: How does the entrance speed feel like?</li>
                <li>A: Is just right, not too slow or too fast.</li>
                <li>Q: What do you see once in the dungeon?</li>
                <li>
                    A: I see some orbs that are quite close to me and I have to look up
                    to see the ones on top
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'> 
                Following the user’s feedback, I moved the center position more
                backward so the player can see all the orbs by looking straight
                forward.
            </p>
            
            <h4>User test 3</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>Last user test was done after the VR app was completed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Q: How does the environment feel like?</li>
                <li>A: It feels nice, it feels pretty cool</li>
                <li>Q: Are you having motion sickness?</li>
                <li>A: No, not really, feels good</li>
                <li>Q: How does the height feel like?</li>
                <li>
                    A: Feels a little bit low, I feel like I am almost touching the
                    floor
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>Moved the player up so it would be further away from the floor</p>
            
            <h3>Break down of the final build</h3>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
                The VR app starts with the player outside of the dungeon. The game
                starts once “Start” the button is clicked.
            </p>
            
            <img class="img-fluid mb-3 mb-lg-0" src="img/frontPuzzler.jpeg" alt="The
                    Puzzler Screenshot" />
            <br /><br />
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
                Game starts by entering the dungeon, there will be orbs floating that
                will light up in a certain order. Player has to follow the sequence to
                win. If player makes a mistake, sound of mistake will play and then
                another sequence will start. After winning, player comes outside of
                the dungeon and will be faced with a billboard with a button to
                restart
            </p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 100px'>
                This VR app project was a great learning experience. Gained the
                knowledge of basic design for VR and its principles. Sketching helps
                with giving you a better picture of what was imagined in your head.
                Having other people test and tell you more from their perspective will
                improve the experience of the app.
