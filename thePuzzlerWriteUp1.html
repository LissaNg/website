              The Puzzler is a VR game that is similar to Simon Says. Instead of following instructions from someone, you have to follow the pattern in which the spheres light up. The Puzzler is a great intro app for those with no VR experience, thisproject focuses on how to design VR environments in a manner that is understandable and pleasant. Designing and developing this gamegave me experience in creating environments effi ciently by taking advantage of axis of symmetry. I was also able to set interactive elements in the game, things like walking, clicking buttons with responsive sound were great things to learn as well.
            </p>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
              The building of this app also taught me about the design process. The design approach I took was to figure out a persona or whom I wanted to build this app for and then going through sketches to havean idea of the end result. I concluded this by doing some basic user testing to make sure the interaction was clear and effi cient. I’ll describe each step in more detail next.

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
              Statement of Purpose: The Puzzler is a simple and easy to use mobile VR app that engages new VR users to solve a puzzle similar to the Simon game in a challenging and fun way.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Persona</h3>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>
                My user for this project is my husband. The user can help the designer understand what can be improved in the VR app. A seamless VR experience is such where you don’t have a feeling that you are in a different space, where things like motion sickness are minimized and your objects have a realistic dimension. Updating every time there is a change can be tedious but it definitely saves time and you can finish your project with more confidence.

                  In my sketches I tried to draw what I wanted in my VR app, having something on paper helped with how I wanted to start building.

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <h4>User test 1</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>
                For my first user test, I asked a user with very little VR experience
                the questions below to help judge if the scale of the building and
                objects in the scene felt appropriate.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Q: How big do you feel?</li>
                <li>A: Feel like this dungeon is either too small or I’m too big</li>
                <li>Q: What is the mood of the place you are in?</li>
                <li>
                    A: Feels mysterious, someplace I would not dare myself to go in if
                    it were real life
                </li>
                <li>Q: How comfortable is it to see the things around you?</li>
                <li>
                    A: I can see everything but feels really small, I feel like I'm in a
                    can of sardines.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
                I had to increase the size of the building so it did not feel like the user will hit their head entering the dungeon.
            </p>
            
            <h4>User Test 2</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>
                My second test was done after adding 2 billboard signs to start and
                restart the game and background sound
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Q: What do you see in this scene?</li>
                <li>
                    A: A billboard that has a welcome message and a start button. And a
                    castle building behind it.
                </li>
                <li>Q: How does the size of the billboard feel like?</li>
                <li>A: Feels right, looks like an “open curtain” thing.</li>
                <li>Q: How does the entrance speed feel like?</li>
                <li>A: Is just right, not too slow or too fast.</li>
                <li>Q: What do you see once in the dungeon?</li>
                <li>
                    A: I see some orbs that are quite close to me and I have to look up
                    to see the ones on top
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'> 
                Following the user’s feedback, I adjusted the users point of view distance so that all orbs are visible by the user when they look forward.
            </p>
            
            <h4>User test 3</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 10px'>Last user test was done after the VR app was completed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Q: How does the environment feel like?</li>
                <li>A: It feels nice, it feels pretty cool</li>
                <li>Q: Are you having motion sickness?</li>
                <li>A: No, not really, feels good</li>
                <li>Q: How does the height feel like?</li>
                <li>
                    A: Feels a little bit low, I feel like I am almost touching the
                    floor
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>Moved the player up so it would be further away from the floor</p>
            
            <h3>Break down of the final build</h3>
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
                The VR app starts with the player outside of the dungeon. The game starts once the “Begin” button is clicked.
            </p>
            
            <img class="img-fluid mb-3 mb-lg-0" src="img/frontPuzzler.jpeg" alt="The
                    Puzzler Screenshot" />
            <br /><br />
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 50px'>
                Game starts by entering the dungeon, there will be orbs floating thatwill light up in a certain order. The player must follow the correct sequence to win, if there is a mistake they will be notified with a sound. At this point another sequence will start and player gets more chances to complete the correct pattern. After winning, the player advances to exit the dugenon and a restart billboard is shown.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p style='color:black; margin-bottom: 100px'>
                This VR app project was a great learning experience. It gave me a sense of what the design process should be and the importance of understanding your user and getting feedback. Sketching helps with giving you a better picture of what was imagined in your head. Overall it gives you a sense of what to expect as a VR developer for end-to-end project.
